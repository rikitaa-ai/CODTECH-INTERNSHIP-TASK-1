Objectives:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze customer demographics to understand the mall's target audience. Additionally, we aim to examine spending patterns in relation to demographic factors to identify trends among different customer segments. Finally, we will detect outliers and derive actionable insights to inform marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

Key Activities:
•	Data Loading:Load the mall customer dataset using Pandas.
•	Data Cleaning:Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., imputation, removal).
•	Descriptive Analysis:Calculate summary statistics for numerical features (mean, median, etc.).
•	Data Visualization:Histograms,Scatter Plots,Heatmaps.
•	Outlier Detection:Use box plots to identify and visualize potential outliers in numerical features.

Technologies Used:
•	Programming Language:Python
•	Data Manipulation Libraries:Pandas,NumPy
•	Data Visualization Libraries:Matplotlib,Seaborn
•	Statistical Analysis Tools:Scipy,Statsmodels
•	Integrated Development Environment (IDE):Jupyter Notebook
•	Data Sources:CSV/Excel Files

Objectives:
The objective of predictive modeling with linear regression is to establish the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to make accurate predictions. It aims to quantify how changes in the independent variables impact the dependent variable, enabling informed decision-making based on data-driven insights.

Key Values:
Dependent Variable (Target): The outcome variable that you are trying to predict (e.g., sales, prices).
Independent Variables (Features): The input variables used to predict the dependent variable (e.g., advertising spend, customer demographics).
Coefficients: The values that represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
Intercept: The expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
R-squared Value: A statistical measure indicating how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable (ranges from 0 to 1).
P-values: Used to determine the significance of each independent variable in predicting the dependent variable.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages:Python,Pandas,NumPy
Data Visualization:Matplotlib and Seaborn 
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):Jupyter Notebook
Data Storage and Management:SQL Databases
